Establishing biomarkers for the validation of early diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using R with accuracy of 88%

Establishing reliable biomarkers for assessing and validating clinical diagnosis at early stages of Parkinson's disease is crucial for developing therapies to slow or halt disease progression. This data set uses whole blood gene expression profiling from over 500 individuals where we will attempt to find a gene signature. This repository contains the gene expression profiles collected in the GENEPARK consortium. The main study sought a classifier for IPD. These data contain 233 healthy controls, 205 IPD patients, and 48 patients with other neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Other samples are available in the data and can be used for additional analyses. The largest class of these additional samples are 22 samples from genetic unaffected controls and 41 genetic PD patients.

Note: the original study which uploaded this data to NIH Geo is not yet published.
